            <h2>Development Walkthrough</h2>
            <p>As part of my second project during my OJT, I was assigned to develop a landing page for an agency company that specializes in deploying Filipino workers overseas as front-end developer. To ensure that the landing page effectively conveyed the agency's services and value proposition, my boss instructed me to visit the agency's office and gather information about their operations and target audience.</p>
            <p>During my visit to the agency office, I worked closely with the project team to gather the necessary information and insights needed to guide the design and development of the landing page. This included conducting interviews with agency personnel and analyzing their website and other promotional materials to better understand their branding and messaging strategies.</p>
            <p>Once I had gathered all the necessary information, I began the development process by creating the UI/UX design for the landing page. I focused on creating an interface that was both visually appealing and user-friendly, taking into account the agency's target audience and their preferences. I also worked closely with the project team to ensure that the landing page accurately reflected the agency's vision and values.</p>
            <p>After the design phase was complete, I moved on to the development phase, using my skills in web development and design to create a functional and engaging landing page. Throughout the development process, I made sure to stay in close communication with the project team to ensure that the final product met their needs and exceeded their expectations.</p>
            <p>Overall, this project was an invaluable learning experience for me, providing me with practical skills in website development and design, client communication, and project management. I am proud to have contributed to the agency's efforts in promoting their services and supporting Filipino workers deployed overseas, and I believe that this project is a strong addition to my portfolio.</p>

		<h2>Guest App Walkthrough Screens</h2>
		<p>During my initial on-the-job training (OJT) project, I was assigned the task of designing a landing page for a Pinoy restaurant situated overseas. The objective of this landing page was to provide information regarding the restaurant's offerings, ambiance, location, and other relevant details to potential customers.</p> 
		<p>To fulfill this task, I employed my skills in website development and design, utilizing various web development tools and techniques to create an engaging and informative landing page that would resonate with the restaurant's target audience. Through my design, I aimed to create a visually appealing, user-friendly interface that would encourage customers to explore the restaurant further and potentially make a reservation.</p> 
		<p>Overall, this project allowed me to apply and further develop my technical and creative abilities in web design while also contributing to the marketing and branding efforts of the restaurant.</p>
