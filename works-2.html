            <h2>Development Walkthrough</h2>
            <p> During my second project as an OJT, I was given the responsibility of designing and developing a landing page for an agency company that deploys Filipino workers overseas as front-end developer. To gather the necessary information about the agency company, I collaborated with the project team and visited the agency office, where I conducted interviews and gathered data to guide the design and development process.</p>
            <p>Using the information gathered, I began the development process by creating the initial UI/UX design for the landing page. As a front-end developer, my focus was on creating an interface that was visually appealing, easy to navigate, and user-friendly. I analyzed the agency's target audience and considered their preferences and expectations when designing the landing page. I also ensured that the landing page aligned with the agency's vision and branding objectives.</p>
            <p>Once the design phase was complete, I moved on to building the landing page, utilizing my skills in web development and design to create a functional and effective website. Throughout the process, I worked closely with the project team to ensure that the final product met the needs and expectations of the agency company, delivering maximum value to their target audience.</p>
            <p>Overall, this project allowed me to gain practical experience in website development and design, as well as client communication and collaboration. By working closely with the agency team, I was able to better understand their requirements and deliver a high-quality product that aligned with their branding and marketing objectives. I am proud to have contributed to this project and believe that it is a valuable addition to my portfolio.</p>

		<h2>Guest App Walkthrough Screens</h2>
		<p>During my initial on-the-job training (OJT) project, I was assigned the task of designing a landing page for a Pinoy restaurant situated overseas. The objective of this landing page was to provide information regarding the restaurant's offerings, ambiance, location, and other relevant details to potential customers.</p> 
		<p>To fulfill this task, I employed my skills in website development and design, utilizing various web development tools and techniques to create an engaging and informative landing page that would resonate with the restaurant's target audience. Through my design, I aimed to create a visually appealing, user-friendly interface that would encourage customers to explore the restaurant further and potentially make a reservation.</p> 
		<p>Overall, this project allowed me to apply and further develop my technical and creative abilities in web design while also contributing to the marketing and branding efforts of the restaurant.</p>
